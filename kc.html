KC's Smoothies App Prototype
</p>
<div class="content">
<p class="sub-title">
Overview
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    For the term-long project in our User Experience I course, our team was tasked with choosing a University City food truck for which to design a mobile app prototype based on user experience testing. For this assignment, our team chose KC’s Smoothies, a local food truck that sells smoothies and other healthy snacks. 
<br>
<br>
We chose this truck based on a few factors. Firstly the word of mouth about the kindness of the owner and quality of the smoothies from a couple of our group members who frequented the truck made it easy for us to get invested and be passionate about designing an experience around it. Additionally, we all liked how focused the brand was catering to a more niche audience and we thought it would be less nebulous to pin down its user groups. Our team hoped to create a viable food ordering app design prototype that we could all be proud of from its visual aesthetic to the polished user experience developed using UX research methods.

</p>
<p class="sub-title">
    The Problem
    </p>
    <p class="main-desc">
        During this project we had a variety of goals/objectives we hoped to accomplish. Many of these primarily revolved around different forms of microinteraction animations we wanted to include to add a touch of personality. We all believed in how much of an impact these small but meaningful interactions could have on the look and feel of our final app design and we wanted things to be as polished as possible for our final submission. 
       <br>
       <br>
        Throughout our process, we stumbled upon many challenges and constraints. While our team didn't have as much trouble drilling into the truck's customer base, in the middle of the term, our truck went on an unannounced hiatus due to a family emergency which hurt our ability to test users who were actively buying smoothies. Luckily many of our team members knew current users of the truck so we were still able to collect relevant data. Additionally, all of our team members were also quite busy during the term and it wasn’t uncommon where we had to shift all of our schedules to fit in group meetings.
        <br>
        <br>
        Personally, I also had trouble advocating for design ideas in a team setting, but I had to learn how to overcome this and settle for many compromisations. Throughout most of the project, there were times where I wanted to head in a different direction in terms of colors, shapes, buttons, sizing, and much more but I also had to keep our timeline in mind. If we had more time and more testing, I would have liked to present an AB testing to our users to showcase that my design ideas could have worked.

        Goals
        </p>
       <ul class="main-desc">
<li>Able to work with teammates efficiently and effectively</li>
<li>Learn more about user testing and the importance of it, then applying it</li>
<li>Showcase a working prototype with a strong design</li>
<li>Understand the importance of business analyzation</li>
       </ul>

Analyzing the Business
</p>
<div class="image-content">

 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    Our team utilized a variety of different UX research methodologies in order to try and get a better handle on KC’s Smoothies business. These techniques included designing a Project & Business Canvas, performing SWOT and 4 C's analyses, grabbing general information from the trucks online presence, analyzing competitors, and through business observation & interviews. 
<br>
<br>
Some of this data was tricky to obtain, especially the business interview as we had to find a time when the owner wasn’t busy attending to her customers to talk to her about her business. 
<br>
<br>
One thing that surprised the team from our data collection was how weak KC’s Smoothies social media presence was (they were only active on Facebook). A key finding that affected our final design was KC’s menu offerings. Because the menu itself is so small and condensed, it played a big role in how we ultimately designed our home page and ordering interfaces.

Target Audience
</p>

    <img class="main-img" src="graphics/kcuser.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    In order to begin breaking down KC’s Smoothies audience, our team again utilized a few different UX research methodologies. These tactics included performing user observations and interviews, creating user personas based on our data, and formulating journey maps for our final user experience. 
<br>
<br>
We had to persevere to obtain some of this data, especially the user interviews, as many customers didn’t really want to take time to talk with us. From our data collection, we discovered that many of our users just wanted a quick efficient process to order smoothies, since it's such a “grab and go” item. This realization absolutely influenced our designs and we tried to be succinct in our ordering process, using as few screens as possible to finish up a smoothie order.

Process & Style Choices
</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img" src="graphics/kcstyles.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    Our team made numerous prototypes during the course of our design iteration for this project. Initially we sketched out some user flows based on our preliminary research, using them as inspiration when creating our first paper prototype for user testing. 
<br>
<br>
From the feedback we received from our paper prototypes, we created our first lo-fi wireframes/flow in Figma. We then tested and made crucial changes to the designs based on our user feedback, from adding new elements like custom tipping and additional order notes, to revising elements we had already created, such as the ordering interface and menu bar. While making all these revisions, our team always collaborated together, first sharing what we learned from our test users, then proposing changes and new ideas till we arrived at a consensus to solve our issues. 
<br>
<br>
From this process our team continued to iterate, designing our mid-fidelity prototype. This prototype added additional functionality and added in our first color and font stylings. To create our design aesthetic, the team created a mood board to capture the feelings we wanted our prototype to evoke. From there, the team settled on preliminary typography and colors, giving our app a new and vivid look. 
<br>
<br>
Using this design, we performed additional user testing resulting in more tweaks and color changes. It was at this period our team really honed in, and focused on polishing our designs for our final high fidelity prototype.

The Results
</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="graphics/kcsolution.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    From where we began with this project the team couldn’t be happier with the direction this prototype took from initial concept first ideas to our final iteration. While the team encountered plenty of obstacles during our ten week design period, our research and user testing guided our design choices, helping us to craft an experience with our users in mind. Ultimately, we believe we succeeded in our vision to create personalized, intuitive, prototype to showcase mobile ordering for KC’s Smoothies.
    <br>
    <br>
    I definitely think that the project could have been tweaked more into a high fidelity prototype, but with the timeframe that we had I am still satisfied with the outcome of the project.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our team learned a lot about user-focused research and design during this experience and can’t wait to bring these new skills to our next endeavors.
