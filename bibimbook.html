Overview
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    The main objective for this project was to create a fully functional recipe website that uses information from an SQL database and displays it onto my website. This was a solo project and had a timeframe of about 10 weeks. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
Background
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    In my Scripting for Interactive Digital Media II class, I was asked to build a custom recipe web application that displays the recipes and provides a user interface that includes browsing, searching, and filtering through all the content. The main functions for this project was to create, edit, delete, and view recipes. Within this project, I was asked to use PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git; This project had a timeline of around three months. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
    The Problem
    </p>
    <p class="main-desc">
        As a UX/UI Designer and Developer, learning PHP is the next step in order to create fully functional websites and apps. So being able to manipulate databases efficiently using PHP, will allow me to become a more efficient developer moving forward. 
    </p>
    <p class="sub-title">
        Goals
        </p>
       <ul class="main-desc">
<li>
    Apply the PHP knowledge that Iâ€™ve developed throughout this class and showcase it through a completely functional website
</li>
<li>Have a well-structured/organized database that is easy to manipulate</li>
<li>Keep the recipe site as simple and easy to navigate for a seamless user experience
</li>
<li>Make sure that the website is visually pleasing to the user </li>
       </ul>

Style Guide

<p class="main-desc">
    I began with ideating the brand of the recipe website. I wanted to create a recipe site for Korean dishes that were quick and approachable. Since it was a Korean recipe site, I wanted to base the colors on a variation of the Korean flag colors.

Alpha Design

<div class="image-content">

 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    Once I completed my overall style tile, I created wireframes and began implementing color where it made most sense. I wanted to keep things simple because of the bright colors I decided to use. I used pink as the main color and blue as an accent color. 
</p>

Development Process
</p>
<div class="image-content">

 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    After the wireframing process, I began to code out the HTML and CSS of the website. During this phase I had a realization that I had to sacrifice some design aspects in order to have a fully functional website within our timeframe. I originally had a filter system on my wireframe but as I continued to flesh out my website, I realized that it was a bit of a scope creep. This was a huge turning point in my site as I began to realize how important the functionality of the website should be rather than the overall design. <br><br>
    Once I had the main HTML and CSS of the website mostly complete, I began implementing the PHP portion of the site. At first, I had trouble with linking pages together but I began to maintain an organized file system and directory, which was key. I used PHP to include a consistent header and footer on every page and to create, edit, delete, search, and view recipes as an admin on my recipe website. <br><br>
    Finally, I linked my files to phpMyAdmin which was the database storage location for all of my recipes. I then created a table for my site which allowed me to display all of my recipes to my site in an organized table. After doing this, I created view, edit, and delete recipe buttons. Next, I uploaded 40 unique Korean recipes to my database and displayed them on my website. <br><br>

   The Solution (The Final Product)
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    A lot of the pages that we created were snippets of things that we learned in lectures and just implementing that to create new elements. After I got the main elements to work, the rest of the project flowed extremely effortlessly. In the end, I built a fully functional website that includes user pages and admin pages where an admin can create, edit, delete, and view any recipe. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
The Results
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    Overall, I am completely satisfied with the result of this project. I was able to create a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and PHP. I also learned how to store and manipulate data in an organized database which allowed me to showcase 40 recipes on my website. If I had a bit more time to work on this project, I would have added a login system that would allow users to log in. Now that I have a better understanding of working with a database, I have a better vision for time management and what I want to spend the most time on when working on a development project. I will now be implementing my knowledge of PHP to create larger scale websites and projects moving forward.
