Doma Redesign
</p>
<div class="content">
<p class="sub-title">
Overview
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    For my UI Design I/II class I redesigned a desktop, tablet, and mobile prototype for Doma restaurant’s website using Figma. For this specific case study, I will be going over the mobile prototype that was made for Doma; The desktop and tablet prototype were already completed by myself at this time. This was a solo project and one of my first design projects and had a timeframe of about 10 weeks. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
Background
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    In my UI Design I/II class, I was asked to redesign Doma restaurant’s website for a responsive display. The main objective for this project was to create a prototype that aligns with the restaurant’s culture/brand and to cater the design to a specific user. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
   The Problem
    </p>
    <p class="main-desc">
        Doma’s current website uses a very standard template look that has no emotion or culture that Doma’s in-person brand displays. I wanted to showcase their modern and contemporary brand throughout this prototype, so the user can truly feel like they’re sitting in the Doma restaurant. 
    </p>
    <p class="sub-title">
        Goals
        </p>
       <ul class="main-desc">
<li>
    Create a prototype that matches Doma’s brand and fully showcases their culture
</li>
<li>Have a well-structured/organized atomic design and style guide</li>
<li>Keep the navigation for the prototype as simple as possible so it matches the user’s tasks
</li>
<li>Make the experience for the user as flawless as possible </li>
       </ul>
<p class="sub-title">
Style Guide
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img" src="graphics/domatypo.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    First, I began with Doma’s logo. Since the logo is such a key factor for Doma’s brand, I built upon the logo by using the same colors and round imagery. These colors also matched the modern, contemporary, and warm aesthetics of Doma. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
User Persona
</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="graphics/audience.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    I created a user persona for Doma’s main target market. Alvina Yakitori is a 25-year-old IT Manager living in Philadelphia. He is fairly extroverted and in his free time loves to go out and find new places to eat but loves to go back to his favorites. His main transportation in the city is biking because it’s hard to find parking and allows him to pick up food efficiently. 
<br>
<br>
    I used this specific persona to think about practical design during the whole process of wireframing and ideation.     
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
Wireframing</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="graphics/domawire.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    I began creating low fidelity wireframes based on the desktop prototype. I wanted to create a menu page, an about us page, and a home page. I started with experimenting with elements from the desktop and tablet prototypes to make it thematically similar. I brought most of the same aspects from the completed prototypes over to the mobile prototype but condensed into a mobile resolution. Afterwards, I began implementing color and figured out a way to create a layout that fits all the aspects from the desktop to mobile. I wanted to create a layout that guides the user's eyes in a path towards the bottom of the page. 
<br>
<br>
The main problem I had was implementing the navigation system to a mobile friendly prototype. I experimented with a condensed header with links within them, but I lost a lot of screen real estate. I then figured out that creating a hamburger menu system was the best way to save screen space and allow for a seamless user experience. 
<br>
<br>
I placed the “reservations” button at the top of the page because it’s one of the user’s main tasks, and specifically added text in the middle section of the page to keep the user engaged. 
<br>
<br>
Then, I started creating meaningful microinteractions using the prototype feature in Figma. I was extremely new to this feature which caused some difficulty but overcame it after I figured out the basic elements of the feature.

   Heuristic Evaluations
 </p>
 <div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="graphics/domaheur.png">
 </div>
 <p class="main-desc">
    In the beginning of the project, we did Heuristic Evaluations based on the current website. We asked a user a series of questions after using Doma’s original website to see how it would compare to the redesigned website at the end of the project. The evaluation was based on visual design, the home page, task orientation, navigation, forms & entries, trust & credibility, writing & content quality, search, and help & feedback. The same user was tested and was asked the same questions after the redesign was complete.
<br>
<br>
You can see by the chart that the original design scores were far more condensed than the redesign. The user enjoyed every aspect of the redesign more than the original. This was a very helpful resource for one of my first projects because it allowed me to see improvement from testing.

   The Solution (The Final Product)
</p>
<div class="image-content">
    <img class="main-img-1" src="graphics/domafinal.png">
 </div>
<p class="main-desc">
    The final product is a fully working app prototype for Doma Restaurant made in Figma. I am extremely happy with how this mobile prototype came out. Throughout this project, I learned many fundamentals of Figma and the basics of UI and UX Design. In the end, I created a mobile prototype with a home page, an about us page, and a menu page. 
</p>
<p class="sub-title">
The Results
</p>
<p class="main-desc">
    Overall, I am completely satisfied with the result of this project. This being one of my first projects, I was very new to design theory and implementation of UX. If I had a bit more time to complete this project, I would definitely think more about spacing and implementing a grid system into the prototype. This project was a great stepping stone into the world of UX/UI Design and I’m glad that I learned so much from this project.
